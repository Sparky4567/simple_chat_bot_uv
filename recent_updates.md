ALIS v.1.0

Initiated entirely new project using uv package manager instead of a simple venv. (Quicker development)
Added similarity treshhold to make answers more accurate.
Tested some inputs, chatted with the bot for a while.
Tested training functionality. (It works, the database is being populated after typing retrain)
Added some tweaks (CTRL + C) exits gracefully (Just a simple KeyboardInterrupt).
Added some tweaks (speak back function + SPEAK_BACK constant) - The bot has a voice from now on.
